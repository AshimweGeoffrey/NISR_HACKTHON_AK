## üìù Important Notes

### Survey Weights
- Use `FinalWeight` for all statistical analyses to ensure representative estimates
- Weights account for sampling design and non-response

### Missing Values
- Check for missing values in each variable before analysis
- Some variables may have "Don't know" or "Refused" categories

### Data Types
- **Categorical**: 472 variables (use for grouping and classification)
- **Numeric**: 323 float64 + 8 int16 + 67 int32 + 90 int8
- **Text**: 120 object variables

### Confidentiality
- This is microdata - ensure proper data handling
- Aggregate results for reporting
- Don't identify individual households

## üöÄ Getting Started with Analysis

### Recommended First Steps:

1. **Load and explore the data**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df_hh = pd.read_stata('CFSVA_HH_2021_MASTER_DATASET.dta')
   df_village = pd.read_stata('CFSVA_2021_VILLAGE.dta')
   df_child = pd.read_stata('CFSVAHH2021_UNDER_5_ChildWithMother.dta')
   ```

2. **Check data quality**
   - Missing values
   - Outliers
   - Data consistency

3. **Apply survey weights**
   ```python
   # For weighted means
   weighted_mean = np.average(df_hh['FCS'], weights=df_hh['FinalWeight'])
   ```

4. **Start with descriptive statistics**
   - Provincial summaries
   - Urban/rural comparisons
   - Key indicator distributions

5. **Create visualizations**
   - Maps of food insecurity
   - Charts of key indicators
   - Trend analysis
