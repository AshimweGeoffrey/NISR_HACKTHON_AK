## 13. Conclusion

The Rwanda CFSVA 2021 reveals a nation making progress on food security (72.6% acceptable food consumption) and breastfeeding practices (93.6%), but facing significant challenges in **child malnutrition** (29.1% stunting) and **infant feeding practices** (only 19.5% meet minimum acceptable diet).

**The analysis identifies clear priorities:**

1. **Geographic:** Northern Province requires urgent attention (39% stunting, 3.3x Kigali)
2. **Economic:** Poorest households face severe malnutrition burden (38.6% stunting, 2.8x wealthiest)
3. **Behavioral:** Massive gap in complementary feeding practices (80.5% below standards)
4. **Temporal:** Stunting worsens with age (22.4% → 35.1%), indicating sustained deprivation

**With targeted interventions** addressing these four dimensions—**geography, poverty, feeding practices, and age-appropriate nutrition**—Rwanda can achieve the national goal of reducing stunting below 20% and ensuring food security for all children.
