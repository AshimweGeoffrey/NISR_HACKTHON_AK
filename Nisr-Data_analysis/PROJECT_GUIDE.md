   - Pulses: 54% experiencing high prices
   - Villages with low availability have 69% chance of high prices

3. **Vulnerability Crisis**

   - 39.3% of villages (354) classified as HIGH vulnerability
   - Western Province most vulnerable (avg score: 6.83/12)
   - Rural areas significantly more vulnerable than urban (p<0.0001)

4. **Wage Disparities**

   - Non-agricultural wages are 99% higher than agricultural
   - Urban non-ag wages are 46% higher than rural
   - Agricultural: 870 RWF/day (~$0.87 USD)
   - Non-agricultural: 1,729 RWF/day (~$1.73 USD)

5. **Most Important Factor**
   - **Road infrastructure** has strongest correlation (r=-0.424) with reduced vulnerability
   - 36.2% of villages lack year-round road access

## üí° Tips for Further Analysis

### 1. **Filter High-Vulnerability Villages**

```python
high_vuln = df[df['vulnerability_level'] == 'High']
# Analyze characteristics of these 354 villages
```

### 2. **Province-Specific Deep Dive**

```python
western = df[df['S0_C_Prov'] == 'Western']
# Why is Western most vulnerable?
```

### 3. **Compare Best vs Worst**

```python
best = df[df['vulnerability_score'] <= 4]
worst = df[df['vulnerability_score'] >= 8]
# What differs between them?
```

### 4. **Create Custom Indicators**

```python
df['food_insecure'] = (
    (df['S5_01_2'] == 'Low (insufficient)') |
    (df['S5_01_3'] == 'Higher that normal')
).astype(int)
```
